## OAuth2 Code
### Remote service
This **[remote service](https://github.com/andreadegiovine/homeassistant-stellantis-vehicles-worker-v2)** simulates a browser login session on the official website to authenticate your account.

<ins>**Your credentials are neither stored nor shared**</ins>

The service is provided by Render.com on a free tier, with performance limitations.

> If you want to support the project and extend these limits, <ins>become a hero</ins> and join our **monthly [supporters club](#support-the-project)**!

### Manual
<details><summary><b>Using browser console</b></summary>

As described on config flow, please get the right code from the mobile app redirect like this example (Chrome browser):

</details>
<details><summary><b>Using python tool</b></summary>

Thanks to [@benbox69](https://github.com/benbox69) for creating this awesome Python tool to fetch oauth code without using browser console: [stellantis-oauth-helper](https://github.com/benbox69/stellantis-oauth-helper)

</details>
<details><summary><b>Using external service</b></summary>

Thanks to [@benbox69](https://github.com/benbox69) for creating this awesome external service to fetch oauth code without using browser console: [OAuth Code Extractor](https://github.com/andreadegiovine/homeassistant-stellantis-vehicles/discussions/378)

## Commands
To use remote commands, the "E-remote" or "Connect Plus" service must be activated and configured in the vehicle.

### WakeUp
For some vehicles no updates are received a few minutes after the engine is turned off. Use automations like these to schedule the vehicle wake up:

```yaml
- id: "standby_wakeup"
  alias: Vehicle standby WakeUp (every 1 hour)
  description: ""
  mode: single
  triggers:
    - trigger: time_pattern
      hours: /1
  conditions:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.#####VIN#####_battery_charging
      state: "off"
  actions:
    - action: button.press
      metadata: {}
      data: {}
      target:
        entity_id: button.#####VIN#####_wakeup
```

```yaml
- id: "charging_wakeup"
  alias: Vehicle charging WakeUp (every 5 minutes)
  description: ""
  mode: single
  triggers:
    - trigger: time_pattern
      minutes: /5
  conditions:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.#####VIN#####_battery_charging
      state: "on"
  actions:
    - action: button.press
      metadata: {}
      data: {}
      target:
        entity_id: button.#####VIN#####_wakeup
```
\* the entity names above are in english, please use your language entity names.

<ins>**Some users report that performing too many wakeups drains the service battery, making some features unavailable (such as keyless entry)**</ins>.

### Air conditioning Start/Stop
As described in the Stellantis apps, the command is enabled when:
1. The vehicle engine is off;
2. The vehicle doors are locked;
3. The battery level is at least ~~50% (20% for hybrids)~~ 20% or in charging ([#226](https://github.com/andreadegiovine/homeassistant-stellantis-vehicles/issues/226));

## Battery capacity / residual sensors
Thanks to the community ([#272](https://github.com/andreadegiovine/homeassistant-stellantis-vehicles/issues/272)), it seems that for some vehicles **Stellantis provides incorrect values**. The **switch.battery_values_correction** entity (in your language) applies a correction if active.

\*currently only to the battery_residual sensor

## Global preferences
These initial choices can be changed in the **Reconfigure** flow under **Global preferences**:
- Enable persistent notifications
- Anonymize personal data on logs

Thanks to the community ([#414](https://github.com/andreadegiovine/homeassistant-stellantis-vehicles/issues/414)), it seems that for some hardware, the "Anonymize personal data on logs" feature makes the environment unstable. It is recommended to disable this feature and enable it only when you need to share logs.

## Errors
<ins>Before any issue request, please check the integration log and look for solution below</ins>.

### OTP error - NOK:MAXNBTOOLS
It seems that this error is due to reaching the limit of associated devices / SMS received. Restore your Stellantis account and try again:
[Follow this procedure from Peugeot community](https://peugeot.my-customerportal.com/peugeot/s/article/AP-I-have-problems-with-the-pin-safety-code-or-I-want-to-change-it-What-can-I-do?language=en_GB).

<ins>**This operation removes the devices connected to your vehicle, no vehicle data will be lost**</ins>.

### OTP error - NOK:NOK_BLOCKED
It seems that this error is due to reaching the limit of wrong PIN used. Re-authenticate the integration.

### Get oauth code error
As described in the "OAuth2 Code > [Remote service](#remote-service)" section, this free service has usage limitations.  
If you've hit these limits, please wait and try again.  
If the problem persists or is unrelated to usage limits, please use "OAuth2 Code > [Manual](#manual)" mode.

## ABRP - A Better Routeplanner
Get a token from [ABRP](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/):
1. Login to your account;
2. Navigate to vehicle settings;
3. Navigate to real time data;
4. Navigate to edit connections;
5. Generate a token using "Generic" method;

Use the generated token in **abrp_token sensor** and enable **abrp_sync switch** to send updates.
