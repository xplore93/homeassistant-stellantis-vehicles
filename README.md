## OAuth2 Code
### Remote service
This **[remote service](https://github.com/andreadegiovine/homeassistant-stellantis-vehicles-worker-v2)** simulates a browser login session on the official website to authenticate your account.

<ins>**Your credentials are neither stored nor shared**</ins>

The service is provided by Render.com on a free tier, with performance limitations.

> If you want to support the project and extend these limits, <ins>become a hero</ins> and join our **monthly [supporters club](#support-the-project)**!

If you'd rather not depend on the shared Render.com instance, you can self-host the
[worker](https://github.com/andreadegiovine/homeassistant-stellantis-vehicles-worker-v2) and enter
its URL in the "Login service URL" field of the config flow's remote-login step instead of the
default one.

### Manual
<details><summary><b>Using browser console</b></summary>

As described on config flow, please get the right code from the mobile app redirect like this example (Chrome browser):

</details>
<details><summary><b>Using python tool</b></summary>

Thanks to [@benbox69](https://github.com/benbox69) for creating this awesome Python tool to fetch oauth code without using browser console: [stellantis-oauth-helper](https://github.com/benbox69/stellantis-oauth-helper)

Thanks to [@benbox69](https://github.com/benbox69) for creating this awesome external service to fetch oauth code without using browser console: [OAuth Code Extractor](https://github.com/andreadegiovine/homeassistant-stellantis-vehicles/discussions/378)

</details>

## Commands
To use remote commands, the "E-remote" or "Connect Plus" service must be activated and configured in the vehicle.

### WakeUp
For some vehicles no updates are received a few minutes after the engine is turned off. Use automations like these to schedule the vehicle wake up:

```yaml
- id: "standby_wakeup"
  alias: Vehicle standby WakeUp (every 1 hour)
  description: ""
  mode: single
  triggers:
    - trigger: time_pattern
      hours: /1
  conditions:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.#####VIN#####_battery_charging
      state: "off"
  actions:
    - action: button.press
      metadata: {}
      data: {}
      target:
        entity_id: button.#####VIN#####_wakeup
```

```yaml
- id: "charging_wakeup"
  alias: Vehicle charging WakeUp (every 5 minutes)
  description: ""
  mode: single
  triggers:
    - trigger: time_pattern
      minutes: /5
  conditions:
    - condition: state
      entity_id: binary_sensor.#####VIN#####_battery_charging
      state: "on"
  actions:
    - action: button.press
      metadata: {}
      data: {}
      target:
        entity_id: button.#####VIN#####_wakeup
```
\* the entity names above are in english, please use your language entity names.

<ins>**Some users report that performing too many wakeups drains the service battery, making some features unavailable (such as keyless entry)**</ins>.

### Air conditioning Start/Stop
As described in the Stellantis apps, the command is enabled when:
1. The vehicle engine is off;
2. The vehicle doors are locked;
3. The battery level is at least ~~50% (20% for hybrids)~~ 20% or in charging ([#226](https://github.com/andreadegiovine/homeassistant-stellantis-vehicles/issues/226));

## Battery capacity / residual sensors
Thanks to the community ([#272](https://github.com/andreadegiovine/homeassistant-stellantis-vehicles/issues/272)), it seems that for some vehicles **Stellantis provides incorrect values**. The **switch.battery_values_correction** entity (in your language) applies a correction if active.

\*currently only to the battery_residual sensor

## Card: Stellantis Vehicles
A new custom card is available to manage the vehicle, the card is configurable from the visual editor or via yaml:
```
type: custom:stellantis-vehicle-card
entity: device_tracker.#####VIN#####_vehicle
hide_features: false
features_icons_size: 20
features:
  - binary_sensor.#####VIN#####_remote_commands
  - sensor.#####VIN#####_battery
hide_content: false
content_icons_size: 14
content:
  - sensor.#####VIN#####_temperature
  - sensor.#####VIN#####_last_trip
hide_actions: false
actions:
  - button.#####VIN#####_wakeup
  - button.#####VIN#####_charge_start
hide_charging_limit: false
hide_charging_start: false
hide_map: false
hide_last_trip: false
hide_last_charge: false
```
\* the entity names above are in english, please use your language entity names.

Some users report bugs during first use or after page refresh ([#440](https://github.com/andreadegiovine/homeassistant-stellantis-vehicles/issues/440), [#441](https://github.com/andreadegiovine/homeassistant-stellantis-vehicles/issues/441)), it seems like a browser or mobile app cache issue.

To reset mobile app cache try: **Settings > app settings > Problem solving > Reset frontend cache**

## Global preferences
These initial choices can be changed in the **Reconfigure** flow under **Global preferences**:
- Enable persistent notifications
- Anonymize personal data on logs

Thanks to the community ([#414](https://github.com/andreadegiovine/homeassistant-stellantis-vehicles/issues/414)), it seems that for some hardware, the "Anonymize personal data on logs" feature makes the environment unstable. It is recommended to disable this feature and enable it only when you need to share logs.

## Errors
<ins>Before any issue request, please check the integration log and look for solution below</ins>.

### OTP error - NOK:MAXNBTOOLS
It seems that this error is due to reaching the limit of associated devices / SMS received. Restore your Stellantis account and try again:
[Follow this procedure from Peugeot community](https://peugeot.my-customerportal.com/peugeot/s/article/AP-I-have-problems-with-the-pin-safety-code-or-I-want-to-change-it-What-can-I-do?language=en_GB).

<ins>**This operation removes the devices connected to your vehicle, no vehicle data will be lost**</ins>.

### OTP error - NOK:NOK_BLOCKED
It seems that this error is due to reaching the limit of wrong PIN used. Re-authenticate the integration.

### Get oauth code error
As described in the "OAuth2 Code > [Remote service](#remote-service)" section, this free service has usage limitations.  
If you've hit these limits, please wait and try again.  
If the problem persists or is unrelated to usage limits, please use "OAuth2 Code > [Manual](#manual)" mode.

### Command status 901 and 300 - Wakeup timeout
**901 (Wakeup Vehicle)** is the wakeup command being forwarded from the Stellantis backend to your vehicle, it doesn't say anything about the vehicle's state by itself. If it's followed by **300 (Timeout)** instead of **0 (Complete)**, the vehicle didn't respond, which means it's in a deep sleep.

Stellantis disables connectivity to protect the 12V battery, the vehicle apps explain it like this:

> Your vehicle has not been used for more than 15 consecutive minutes in the last 7 days. To preserve your 12V battery, connectivity is disabled.

This is tracked per vehicle, not per integration: any trip shorter than 15 minutes doesn't count, no matter how close it gets. If all your trips in the last 7 days were under 15 minutes, connectivity gets disabled and every wakeup times out until a trip passes the threshold again.

To avoid repeated timeouts, take at least one trip longer than 15 minutes every 7 days.

## ABRP - A Better Routeplanner
